# JavaScript Web Application 

A deep dive in using promises, async await, DOM Manipulation, setTimeout, BOM Manipulation, working with modules and an external API to POST and GET data. 

## Spoonacular Recipe Application

This application practices fetching data from an external API named spoonacular. At Spoonacular you are able to fetch recipes, search for recipes, and create a recipe card which is what you are able to do in this app. The user is able to search for recipes based off of an ingredient. The user is then able to create their own recipe card by filling out a form and making a POST request to the API. I practice using promises, async, await, manipulate the DOM, export and import modules, and create an HTML page that is responsive.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

All of the dependencies are in the package.json file

### Installing

No modification needed just run npm install. 

### Executing program

run npm install to install the packages, then run npm start to start the application. 

## Help

You are going to have to make sure the API_KEY is still valid and does not exceed the allowed request. It will reset every 24 hours.
